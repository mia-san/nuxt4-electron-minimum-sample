# nuxt4-electron-minimum-sample
minimum sample project with nuxt4 and electron.

`npm run dev` should start development build.
`npm run electron:build` should build 'installer'.

please feel free to clone, fork, modify etc.

see [step-by-step-guide.md](https://github.com/mia-san/nuxt4-electron-minimum-sample/blob/main/step-by-step-guide.md)

nuxt3 should work in almost same steps.

thanks for [nuxt-electron](https://github.com/caoxiemeihao/nuxt-electron)
